# TABEXT-01: Read the fret digits that TAB extraction excludes before the route

- **Repository:** `tticom/score2gp`
- **Author:** `tticom-codex` (CP-13 author lane)
- **Requirement:** REQ-0001
- **Depends on:** none
- **Branch:** `feat/tabext-01-read-fret-digits-excluded-before-the-route`

Private fixtures: the corpus is grouped by category on fixtures `main`; the author launcher flattens it into `fixtures/private/`. Verify the files named below exist there before starting; if any is missing, stop and say exactly what is missing. Every number below is a lead: re-measure it on the current runtime, and do not trust an older survey.

## Goal

REFUSE-13's whole-set measurement (46 PDFs, 863 bars written) found that the largest honest part of notation_note_without_tab_digit / no_tab_column_at_notation_event is not a notation problem: about 8 bars in 4 sources print ordinary fret digits (chords and single notes) that TabRaw excluded before the route, under pdf_fret_page_or_legend_number_excluded, pdf_fret_multidigit_extracted, pdf_fret_digits_not_merged_exceeds_max_fret and pdf_fret_digit_symbol_overlap_ambiguous. One more bar is a tied chord whose TAB digits are bracketed at a system start, and one TAB row of a staffless source loses its digits the same way. Leads, not facts: re-measure. Read a digit as a fret only where its position on a string line and its size make it unambiguous; a number that is a page number, a legend or a tempo mark must stay excluded.

## Acceptance

1. Measure first with the normal CLI over every approved PDF: record per affected bar the located reason (page, system, bar, event, code, cause) and rank the causes by bar count. Counts and codes only in the handback. Classify every refused class as a reader gap, a representation gap or unknown, never as a correct refusal: every approved fixture except the blank No Notes file is real teaching material a human can play from (maintainer, 2026-11-04). A bar the evidence cannot yet settle stays refused with a located reason, never guessed, and is reported as unfinished. For each excluded digit group say why it was excluded and what it is on the printed page (view the page).
2. Fix the extraction so a real fret digit is kept: separate it from page numbers and legends by position, size and line membership, and merge adjacent digits into one fret only where they sit on one string line within the glyph spacing. Never loosen a maximum-fret or overlap guard to write more bars: a digit that the evidence cannot settle stays excluded with its located reason.
3. Report before and after over the whole private set: bars written, bars refused by code, and every source whose written GPIF changed. Every source that converted before must keep a byte-identical inner Content/score.gpif unless a refused bar became written, which the handback lists. Check each newly written bar against its reference where a readable one exists, otherwise against the printed page, and say which. Reference-less sources are labelled not independently verified.
4. A named mutant (drop the new rule) fails a test on a real source; synthetic tests carry no acceptance weight and the handback says so.
5. Nothing that worked may change; validation commands pass; handback complete.

## Rules (all tasks, maintainer direction 2026-10-16)

- **Commercial goal.** The product must convert real engraved guitar tab PDFs to Guitar Pro files correctly. Prefer the change that makes more real bars come out right over polish; never trade correctness for coverage. A bar that cannot be written correctly stays refused with a located reason.
- **Tests must be able to fail.** Write only tests that fail when the code is unfit for its purpose: for every new test name the wrong implementation it rejects (a mutant) and show that mutant failing. Acceptance rests on genuine approved sources (the private corpus, counts and labels only, never content); synthetic or generated fixtures carry zero acceptance weight for recognition, grouping, geometry, timing or fidelity and may only supplement non-domain infrastructure with a stated rationale.
- **Never** invent a value, copy it from a reference file into code, loosen a gate, delete or skip a test, or weaken an assertion.
- **Scope.** `allowed_paths` is the expected area, not a wall. Edit what the task needs and list each path outside the area, with the reason, in the handback. Never edit CI, private fixtures or reference files, agent instruction files or the control plane (`scripts/score2gp_*`, `ORCHESTRATION_STATE.json`, prompts, skills): stop and name the path if one is needed.
- **Private content** is never committed. Report counts, codes, sizes and times only.
- **Validation:** `python -m pytest` (list the known Windows baseline failures by ID if they fail locally), export-schema, validate-ir, `scripts/artifact_audit.py`, `git diff --check`.
- **Protect what already works:** DUR-02/03, OMIT-01 to OMIT-05, LAYOUT-01, MEM-01, CFW-04, PARTIAL-01, SCALE-01, TUPLET-TAB-01, PDF-GROUP-02, UNREAD-01/02, PERF-01.
